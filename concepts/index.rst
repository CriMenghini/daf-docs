We introduce the philosophy behind the DAF introducing the following core concepts:

-  `Dataset <dataset>`__ - the DAF platform revolves around the
   concept of dataset. In fact, all data stored in the DAF are organized
   into logical entities called dataset: as a consequence, it is crucial
   to understand how the concept of dataset is modelled in the DAF
   platform.
-  `Metadata & Schemas <dataset-metadata-schemas>`__ - to describe the
   content and the structure of a dataset, the DAF platform specifies a
   minimum set of metadata, and additional metadata useful to homogenize
   the format of data collected from various datasources.

DAF - Security & Privacy Issues
===============================

Data at rest security policies
------------------------------

The default storage platform is HDFS, so once the data has been put on
HDFS must be protected using the proper permissions. Moreover, since the
data need to be accessible through Impala, a set of proper permissions
should be provided to Sentry to open the data to the authorized users.

Regardless the data is accessed either from HDFS or through Impala the
security policies should be the same. That means that the security rules
defined regardless the particular data acces and should be compiled into
prpper permissions rule either on HDFS or Sentry.

Security rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Data Ownerhip**

Any data set should be owned by an identified principal. Even in case of
an organisation a specific user should be identified as the owner of
that specific dataset.

2. **Singler User Group**

Any user should have a corresponding group named with the same username,
i.e. a user David Greco with a username ``david`` should have a group
called ``david`` containing only the username ``david``.

This is the default in the POSIX world, in case of an integration with
Active Directory this policy needs to be enforced.

The reason of this rule lies in the fact that Sentry doesn't allow to
grant a privilege to a user but only to a group. Since, we want to
maintain the single owner principle with to resort to this policy to
maintain our security approach coherent.

3. **Access Delegation**

Only the dataset owner is allowed to provide access to it.

For example, if a dataset ``D`` is owned by ``david``, only ``david``
can give read access to D to another user ``paul``.

Implementing this rule means appliying to the dataset HDFS directories
additional HDFS ACLs and to grant specific roles at the Sentry level as
we will show later.

The same rule apply in case a user wants to provide access to a group.
In general the dataset owner can give access to the dataset to a
combination of users and groups.

4. **Access Rights**

The access rights are only two: READ and WRITE, these rights as said
before have to be mapped on proper HDFS ACLs and Sentry roles and
grants.

### Security Rules and mapping on HDFS and Sentry

Let's start with ordinary data first. So, we know that the ordinary data
HDFS layout is defined in the following way:

``/ daf / ordinary /``

The content of this directory is organized adopting the following rules:

``sourceOrg / domain / subdomain / datasetName.stage.datasetFormat /``

where:

-  ``sourceOrg`` is the name of the organization owning the dataset.
   This name is specified as ``organizationType_organizationName``
-  ``domain`` is the parent category to which the dataset belong (e.g.
   "mobility")
-  ``subdomain`` is the sub-category to which the dataset belong (e.g.
   "traffic")
-  ``datasetName`` is the name of the dataset
-  ``stage`` is the particular stage of the dataset in the
   transformation pipeline, ex. ``landing``, ``stage1``
-  ``datasetFormat`` specifies the serialization format. At the moment
   the Allowed format are: ``csv``, ``json``, ``avro``, ``parquet``.

So, let's suppose that a representative user for ``sourceOrg`` is
``dataowner`` then the following rules should be applied to HDFS:

1. ``hdfs dfs -chown -R dataowner:dataowner /daf/ordinary/sourceOrg/domain/subdomain/datasetName.stage.datasetFormat``
2. ``hdfs dfs -chmod  -R go-rwx /daf/ordinary/sourceOrg/domain/subdomain/datasetName.stage.datasetFormat``
3. ``hdfs dfs -setfacl -R -m user:impala:rwx /daf/ordinary/sourceOrg/domain/subdomain/datasetName.stage.datasetFormat``

1) This fix the ownership to the orgamnisation's representative user.
2) Only the dataset owner has full access to that dataset.
3) The impala user need access to all the datasets since Impala doesn't
   support secure impersonation and all the daemons run under the impala
   user.

All the directories rooted under ``/daf/ordinary/sourceOrg`` should
follow the same rules.

Once the HDFS rules has been applied the next step is to apply a set of
rules at the Sentry side to implement logically the same security rules
we described before:

First of all a proper database should be created to hold the dataset,
the database should be named accordingly with the following naming
convention:

``domain``\ \_\_\ ``subdomain``

in Impala SQL DDL commands:

``CREATE DATABASE domain__subdomain``

Then an external table should be created pointing to the dataset
directory, something like:

::

    CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE  domain__subdomain.dataset_stage_format
    (
       ...
    )
    ...
    LOCATION '/daf/ordinary/sourceOrg/domain/subdomain/dataset.stage.format';

Then proper Sentry roles and rights should be granted:

This is for the database:

::

    CREATE ROLE db_domain__subdomain_role;
    GRANT ALL ON DATABASE domain__subdomain TO ROLE db_domain__subdomain_role;
    GRANT ROLE db_domain__subdomain_role TO GROUP dataowner;
    INVALIDATE METADATA;

where the dataowner group is actually a group containing only the user
``dataowner`` as dictated by the security rule 2.

Then, this is for the table:

::

    CREATE ROLE table_domain__subdomain__dataset_stage_format_role;
    GRANT SELECT ON TABLE domain__subdomain.dataset_stage_format TO ROLE table_domain__subdomain__dataset_stage_format_role;
    GRANT ROLE table_domain__subdomain__dataset_stage_format_role TO GROUP dataowner;
    INVALIDATE METADATA;

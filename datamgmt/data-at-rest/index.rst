Data at rest
============

Once data arrive in the landing area, they are stored in the HDFS
adopting the rules described above.

It is worth noting data are always related to a dataset and they are
converted in AVRO format by-default. Furthermore, a copy of the
unaltered data sent by data-sources is always saved.

On the basis of the settings provided by the dataset owner during the
registration phase, data can be also stored as Parquet file.

Data organization in HDFS
-------------------------

Data in HDFS are stored adopting the following folder structure. The
forder structure is designed to be as flexible as possible based on the
use cases of each dataset type (Standard, Ordinary and Raw).

Since the file format is derivable by the directory name, all files are
stored by using the following naming convention:

``YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS``

where:

-  ``YYYY`` stands for four-digit year date
-  ``MM`` stands for two-digit month date
-  ``DD`` stands for two-digit day date
-  ``HH`` stands for two-digit hour date
-  ``MM`` stands for two-digit minute date
-  ``SS`` stands for two-digit second date

Standard Dataset Directory Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All Standard datasets are stored in the following HDFS directory:

``/ daf / standard /``

The content of this directory is organized adopting the following rules:

``domain / subdomain / datasetName.datasetFormat / sourceOrg /``

where:

-  ``domain`` is the parent category to which the dataset belong (e.g.
   "mobility")
-  ``subdomain`` is the sub-category to which the dataset belong (e.g.
   "traffic")
-  ``datasetName`` is the name of the dataset
-  ``datasetFormat`` specifies the serialization format. At the moment
   the Allowed format are: ``csv``, ``json``, ``avro``, ``parquet``.
-  ``sourceOrg`` is the name of the dataset owner. This name is
   specified as ``organizationType_organizationName``.

Ordinary Dataset Directory Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All Ordinary datasets are stored in the following HDFS directory:

``/ daf / ordinary /``

The content of this directory is organized adopting the following rules:

``sourceOrg / domain / subdomain / datasetName.stage.datasetFormat /``

where:

-  ``sourceOrg`` is the name of the organization owning the dataset.
   This name is specified as ``organizationType_organizationName``
-  ``domain`` is the parent category to which the dataset belong (e.g.
   "mobility")
-  ``subdomain`` is the sub-category to which the dataset belong (e.g.
   "traffic")
-  ``datasetName`` is the name of the dataset
-  ``stage`` is the particular stage of the dataset in the
   transformation pipeline, ex. ``landing``, ``stage1``
-  ``datasetFormat`` specifies the serialization format. At the moment
   the Allowed format are: ``csv``, ``json``, ``avro``, ``parquet``

Raw Dataset Directory Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All Raw datasets are stored in the following HDFS directory:

``/ daf / raw /``

The content of this directory is organized adopting the same naming
convention used for Ordinary datasets, that is:

``sourceOrg / domain / subdomain / datasetName.stage.datasetFormat /``

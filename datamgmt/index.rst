We introduce the philosophy behind the data management architecture of
the DAF platform describing the following topics:

-  `Dataset <dataset>`__ - the DAF platform revolves around the
   concept of dataset. In fact, all data stored in the DAF are organized
   into logical entities called dataset: as a consequence, it is crucial
   to understand how the concept of dataset is modelled in the DAF
   platform.
-  `Metadata & Schemas <dataset-metadata-schemas>`__ - to describe the
   content and the structure of a dataset, the DAF platform specifies a
   minimum set of metadata, and additional metadata useful to homogenize
   the format of data collected from various datasources.
-  `Adding a new dataset <dataset-adding>`__
-  `Data ingestion <data-ingestion>`__
-  `Data at rest <data-at-rest>`__
-  `Data in use <data-in-use>`__
-  `Data and insights publication <data-insights-publication>`__

 
Catalog Manager
============================================================


What is?
----------

**Catalog Manager** is the microservices responsible to store and retrieve metadata associated to datasets stored in  `Daf <https://github.com/italia/daf/>`__. 
It uses a docker compose `ckan  <https://github.com/lorenzoeusepi77/ckanlast>`_ based storage layer as backend. It is developed following the `OpenApi specification <https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification>`_ 
and  contract first design pattern. Every microservice can run as a standalone module using mock data. We recommend to use the local integrated environment.

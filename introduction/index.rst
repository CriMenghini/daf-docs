Data & Analytics Framework
==========================

The `Data & Analytics Framework <https://pianotriennale-ict.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/09_data-analytics-framework.html>`_ (DAF, in short) is an open source project
developed in the context of the activities planned by the
Italian `Three-Year Plan for ICT in Public Administration 2017 - 2019 <https://pianotriennale-ict.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_,
approved by the Italian Government in the 2017.

In this scenario, the main goal of the DAF is to promote the exchange of
public data between Italian PAs, to support the diffusion of open data,
and to enable data-driven policies.
The Italian instance of the DAF is developed and maintanied by a **Data Team** composed by data scientists and data engineers,
which uses and evolves the framework to analyze data, create machine learning models and build data applications and data visualization products.

Anyway, the DAF is a generic enough tool to be re-used in other countries
and other application domains. In fact, the DAF is composed by:

- a **Dataportal**, a Web user interface providing:

   - a catalog of open-data datasets based on `CKAN <https://ckan.org>`_;
   - a set of tools for data analysis and visualization;
   - a tool to handle data ingestion, data and metadata management processes;
   - a tool for publishing and sharing data stories.

- a **Big Data platform** to centralize and store, manipulate and standardize and re-distribute data and insights.

The DAF is under development. This is a snapshot of the roadmap:

- By October 2017: Alpha release.
- By November 2017: Beta release.
- By December 2017: 1.0 release.

Both the Alpha and Beta releases will be tested by selected communities and Italian PAs.

All contributes are welcome!
